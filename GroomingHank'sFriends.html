<h2>Hank's Guide to Grooming</h2>
 <p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Dogs can have many different problems with nails, teeth, ears, eyes, skin, and coat but are unable to communicate that 
    there is something wrong. With regular grooming, a pet parent can discover any problems, such as matted hair, tick and flea 
    infestations, and many other issues before they become problems.
    </li>
    <br>
  <li>
    A dog's coat, skin, and general health are affected by his or her diet and the treats given.  The better the dog eats, the better the
    condition.  We feed all natural, meat-first dry dog food.  We supplement with a lot of dog-friendly fruits and veggies.  Webber hates
    bananas, but Hank and Walker love them.  They all three love carrots!!! <img src="carrots.jpg" height="15" width="20" alt="picture

  <br>
  <li>
    Sometimes, dogs experience stress when being groomed. Persistance and patience are key to making grooming time a pleasant experience
    for your pet.  Hank and his brothers enjoy being washed and brushed now but have not always felt that way.  Walker is still learning
    to appreciate nail clippers but he is very high energy.  It has taken longer with him than the others.  
  </li>
<br>
  <li>
    Brushing your dog can result in quality time spent together with the benefit of a beautiful coat.  Dog's with an undercoat, like Hank's
    big brothers, need to have a special de-shedding tool to remove the excess undercoat.  Be sure not to overbrush with the deshedding tool;
    only 2-3 times per spot.
