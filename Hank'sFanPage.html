 <p>Scout, our beautiful, long-haired tabby cat, loves to play in and around boxes like most cats do.  This was taken a few years ago 
   in my home office after I received a shipment of office supplies.

<p> Hank and Nigel have been the best of friends since the day they were introduced to each other.  Nigel is a rescue kitty that I 
  fostered from just after birth and decided to adopt.  Nigel gets great enjoyment out of torturing Hank and Hank loves every minute.

 Sven is a special boy rescue who has a great big personality.  He is always eager to give kisses and accept belly rubs!  He loves the 
 outdoors and chasing lizards, birds, and squirrels.

 This is my childhood dog, Max.  He was one of the two boxers we had at the time.
