 <h2>Hank's History:</h2> 
 <p>Hank is a 7-year-old Chihuahua who was found wondering in my parents' neighborhood with a big pack of dogs on the Fourth of July when 
   he was about 1-1/2 years old.  At about 6 pounds, he was the smallest of them but his strong Chihuahua personality made him the mightiest.  
   He was thin and wiry, with a deerhead face, and his tail appeared to have a small ball of fur at the tip, which is odd for a short-haired 
   Chihuahua.  Upon further investigation, we found his tail to have had experienced some sort of trauma and under that ball of fur was actually 
   a bone malformation. His tail was about half the size of what a normal Chihuahua should have.  He had a big attitude but a 
   big, loving personality, and our son immediately fell in love with this little guy.  After about two weeks of looking for his owner with 
   no success, we took him home to join our family which included our beautiful 8-year-old tabby cat, Scout, and a 7-year-old Golden 
   Retriever, Webber.

   We have since added three more pets to the family, Nigel, the tuxedo cat, Voldetort, the Russian Tortoise, and Walker, the black lab/redbone 
   hound mix.
